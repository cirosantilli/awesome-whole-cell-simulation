MOVING TO: https://github.com/cirosantilli/cirosantilli.github.io/ as part of Ciro's plan to unify his educational repos as much as possible so that they will survive the apocalypse when GitHub makes a backup only of every proejct with more than 1000 stars.

Because sometimes you just want to simulate single prokaryotic biological living whole cell models starting from DNA to minute detail to understand how it works and predict simple experimental observations.

== The idea

I was thinking maybe something along:

* precalculated interactivity of the molecules (simulated?!) to speed things up
* then discretize cell spatially. TODO necessary? if yes, maybe a 2D slice type of model, on GPU? Model molecule concentration with time in each slot.
* Then modify genome, determine what proteins come out. Protein folding simulations?!
* precalculate interactions of new proteins, and loop

Difficulties:

* can you get enough data out of a single cell? How long until it doubles? Do the cells interact with one another, and or change the extracelullar medium noticeably? Having single cells would be simpler and more precise.
+
Another option is to make on huge cell in a <<cell-free>> environment:

== Cell free

Since cells are themselves to complicated, maybe we can start with simplified DNA systems?

* https://www.synbio.cam.ac.uk/initiatives/cell-free-synthetic-biology possibly by mashing up many cells. I need some references on that.

=== Gene editing

Ah, it would be even more awesome if we could hack up the cells and see them do stuff.

Heart only in second half 2010's did it become possible to edit genes, but coding the entire DNA from scratch is still too expensive.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome_editing

Previously, you would have to:

* shine life with UV to get random modifications
* inject plasmids by electrict or heat shocks: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmid

and then kill ones that didn't get the gene, which is less reliable.

Questions that beg for a database answer:

* https://www.quora.com/How-quickly-do-bacteria-reproduce

=== How to download the genomes?

It is freaking hard to get the FASTA with `wget` links? OMG it is so bad.

http://seqanswers.com/forums/showthread.php?t=18354

Best way so far is to get accession number of type `NC_001416.1` and then:

....
wget -O NC_001416.1.fasta 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/api/sequence/NC_001416.1/?report=fasta'
....

TODO:

* where is that API documented?
* how to download zipped data?
* data sources?
* how is population genetic variation accounted for?
* what do the `NNNN` mean? Uknown? Present on human genome.
* what are the "unlocalized genomic scaffold" regions?

=== Data formatss

==== FASTA

==== FASTQ

FASTA + unstandardized ASCII scores for base pair calls.

Widely output by sequencing machines as of 2010's.

=== Bowtie2

....
git clone https://github.com/BenLangmead/bowtie2
cd bowtie2

"$BT2_HOME/bowtie2" -x lambda_virus -U "${BT2_HOME}/example/reads/reads_1.fq" -S eg1.sam
....

What happened:

* `example/reference/lambda_virus.fa` is the input <<fasta>> file with the reference genome
* `reads_1.fq` is a <<fastq>> file with the reads and the base call quality.
+
The bowtie2 manual says that these were just generated from the reference genome input, and are not real read data.
+
This program can also generate such fake data from reference genomes: https://github.com/nh13/DWGSIM
* `eg1.sam` is the output, which says where each read is most likely to go. It is documented at: https://github.com/samtools/hts-specs

TODO: how to:

* visualize `eg1.sam` alignment? Possibly: https://github.com/igvteam/igv/
* convert `eg1.sam` into the most likely FASTA?
