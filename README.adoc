Because sometimes you just want to simulate single prokaryotic biological living whole cell models starting from DNA to minute detail to understand how it works and predict simple experimental observations.

== The idea

I was thinking maybe something along:

* precalculated interactivity of the molecules (simulated?!) to speed things up
* then discretize cell spatially. TODO necessary? if yes, maybe a 2D slice type of model, on GPU? Model molecule concentration with time in each slot.
* Then modify genome,, determine what proteins come out. Protein folding simulations?!
* precalculate interactions of new proteins, and loop
