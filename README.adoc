Because sometimes you just want to simulate single prokaryotic biological living whole cell models starting from DNA to minute detail to understand how it works and predict simple experimental observations.

== The idea

I was thinking maybe something along:

* precalculated interactivity of the molecules (simulated?!) to speed things up
* then discretize cell spatially. TODO necessary? if yes, maybe a 2D slice type of model, on GPU? Model molecule concentration with time in each slot.
* Then modify genome,, determine what proteins come out. Protein folding simulations?!
* precalculate interactions of new proteins, and loop

Difficulties:

* can you get enough data out of a single cell? How long until it doubles? Do the cells interact with one another, and or change the extracelullar medium noticeably? Having single cells would be simpler and more precise.
+
Another option is to make on huge cell in a <<cell-free>> environment:

== Cell free

Since cells are themselves to complicated, maybe we can start with simplified DNA systems?

* https://www.synbio.cam.ac.uk/initiatives/cell-free-synthetic-biology possibly by mashing up many cells. I need some references on that.

=== Gene editing

Ah, it would be even more awesome if we could hack up the cells and see them do stuff.

Heart only in second half 2010's did it become possible to edit genes, but coding the entire DNA from scratch is still too expensive.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome_editing

Previously, you would have to:

* shine life with UV to get random modifications
* inject plasmids by electrict or heat shocks: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmid

and then kill ones that didn't get the gene, which is less reliable.
